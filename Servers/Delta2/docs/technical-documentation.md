## Description

The provisioning is by design [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence). You can run run the provisioning over and over, the server will stay configured according to the config file.

## Provisioning steps

1. Run [PSScriptAnalyser](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer) (Powershell Linting Tool)
2. Ensure download path for installation files exists (set by downloadpath in config file)
3. Install the IIS Windows Feature/Role
4. Download and install Webdeploy. Used to deploy the ASP.NET demo webapp
5. Install .NET support:
    * .NET Framework 3.5 will not be installed:
        - This is a common error and as of 02/10/2019 there is stil no fix
        - There is however a [workaround](https://sysmanrec.com/installing-net-framework-3-5-on-server-2019-fails)
    * .NET Framework 4.5 installs like a normal Feature/Role
    * ASP .NET Core/.NET Core 2.1, 2.2 and 3.0 are installed by downloading the [Runtime & Hosting Bundle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core)
    * After the installation of .NET, the webservices are restarted
6. Configure IIS access to webroot location
7. Deploy the demo webapp:
    * Currently, we only supported to deploy using a .zip package
    * The complete package needs to be the project and the <project_name>.Deploy.cmd and corresponding .xml files. For an example, check [/Servers/Delta2/test-env/provisioning/files/deploy-site](/Servers/Delta2/test-env/provisioning/files/deploy-site)
    * The configuration of the deploy package is focused on using the **Default Web Site**
8. Add binding for HTTPS by using the default certificate, generated by the host
9. Join the domain **red.local**
