# Integration strategy -- week 4

## Description

The integration strategy of the first iteration plans to join Alfa2, Bravo2, Kilo2 and November together.
Every host has internet access and is connected to each other.
By design, further network implementation will take place during another iteration.
This is to exclude any pitfalls in the connectivity between the hosts that might occur during the integration.

## Integration process

### Network

*Members:* [JensVL](https://github.com/JensVL) & [RobinVandeWalle](https://github.com/RobinVandeWalle)

*Note:* Since we have no immediate access to L3 switches, these will each be swapped out by a router and a L2 switch

#### Criteria

* All hosts reside in the same VLAN
* IP addresses are configured according to the IP table
* All devices can ping each other and have internet connectivity

#### Process

1. Configure the routers and switches through a console connection(Use the IP table provided by the network team)
2. Connect all devices
3. Connect the switches to the patch panel going to one of the tables
4. Take a picture of the cables in the server room for future reference

#### Test

| Host           | IP         | Subnet |
|----------------|------------|--------|
| LaptopGhent01  | 172.18.0.2 | /24    |
| LaptopGhent02  | 172.18.0.3 | /24    |
| LaptopAalst01  | 172.18.0.3 | /24    |
| Win10-client01 | 172.18.0.5 | /24    |
| Win10-client02 | 172.18.0.6 | /24    |

1. [X] In Ghent, connect 2 laptops to an outlet going to the patch panel
2. [X] Configure a static IP on both laptops according to the IP table
3. [X] Disable the firewall on both laptops
4. [X] Ping each other
5. [X] Enable the firewall on both laptops(Security measure for the next step)
6. [ ] Test internet connectivity on both laptops
    * problem in NAT config
7. [ ] Configure a Windows 10 VM with *ONLY* a bridge adapter and a static IP according to the IP table
8. [ ] Launch the Windows 10 VM, this client will later be used to join the domain
9. [ ] Disable the VM's firewall
10. [ ] Ping the VM from the other laptop
11. [ ] Enable the VM's firewall
12. [ ] Test internet connectivity on the VM
13. [ ] In Aalst, connect a laptop to the same VLAN as the one in Ghent
14. [ ] Repeat step 7 and 8 on the laptop in Aalst
15. [ ] Configure a static IP on the laptop according to the IP table
16. [ ] Disable the firewalls on all 4 hosts
17. [ ] In Aalst, ping the 3 hosts in Ghent
18. [ ] In Ghent, ping the host in Aalst from the 3 hosts
19. [ ] Enable the firewalls on the laptop hosts but leave the firewalls of the VMs off

#### Test remarks

*TODO:* take notes during test

* Ping outside Hogent is disabled
* Connect router to table socket with nÂ° greater than 6 and connect the table socket 
to another table socket lower than 6 for internet connectivity
